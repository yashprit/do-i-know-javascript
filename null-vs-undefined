#What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?
###undefined
undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value
~~~
var myVariable;
console.log(myVariable); // undefined
console.log(typeof myVariable); //undefined
~~~

###null
null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value:

~~~
var myVariable = null;
console.log(myVariable); //null
console.log(typeof myVariable); //object
~~~
